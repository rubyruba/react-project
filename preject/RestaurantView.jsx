// Let's create a small restaurant application, using what we already learned so far.
// [ ] Task 1: What we want to see is a list of the dishes that we have in the mocks/dishes.json file
//     Notice the dishes reference image files in the /public/images directory
//
// [ ] Task 2: then we will exercise our React powers by filtering and displaying only the dishes that match our filter
//     We should have a search bar where we update our list as soon as the input changes, and display all items if nothing is in our filter
//
// [ ] Task 3: then we will add routing to display not only the list of dishes, but also each dish individually by ID
//     We should have a main / route and a /meal/:id route at least
